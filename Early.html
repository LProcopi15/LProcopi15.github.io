	<h2>The Early Years</h2>
	<p>I was born in Gloucester, Virginia which is a small town near Williamsburg. I had the typical American life with two sisters, three dogs and a cat. <img src="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?ui=2&ik=2642407221&view=fimg&th=146b3f785774d308&attid=0.7&disp=inline&safe=1&attbid=ANGjdJ90GqxWXu2Pykywt8uqqlMWlDs7zJjtBS0aWDhWPZAwMqTcnZBeWedvhvYjisY-77bWCYzEnzbDLwDnA5cmooVB5kB2SorFBvKnezSQ1koh6qDqAxLYg2gF4Y4&ats=1403178685019&rm=146b3f785774d308&zw&sz=w537-h446" class="images"><br> When I was two years old my family moved to Germany for my dad's work. Living in Germany was a life changing experiece. I went to a British preschool and traveled all over Europe during the summer. <img src="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?ui=2&ik=2642407221&view=fimg&th=146b3f785774d308&attid=0.1&disp=inline&safe=1&attbid=ANGjdJ-HHczT48_uVgIKWKGxhivzMCkL5mac6HYcRLqdoOqQxKZ8EFQ8IUzGK1eW6NFzukxIa0MOlcZZVz2xxNC4_PJ0o_iJOtSf9nuQdqxgn9G6MkWDgJYW4rr9Buk&ats=1403178685018&rm=146b3f785774d308&zw&sz=w537-h446" class="images"><br> This amazing experience gave me the desire to travel the world and experience other cultures.
