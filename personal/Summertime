	<h2>Summertime</h2>
	<p>Earlier this summer I enjoyed a nice trip to the beach with my family where we road horses, went kayaking, and played minigolf. Currently I am in Capetown, South Africa with a startup company named iexperience. The aim of the company is to provide students with an opportunity to enjoy to beauty of Cape Town while learning valuable computer programming skills. The first four weeks will be an intense coding bootcamp and the next four weeks will an internship with another local company.</p>
