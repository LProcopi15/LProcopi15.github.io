		<h2>Interests!!</h2>
		<p>At UVa, I enjoy trying new things. This year I volunteered at a local middle school and tutored middle school students in all subjects that they needed help with. I also really enjoyed playing intramural soccer. I played club all throughout high school and when I went off to college I missed the team spirit and feeling of camaraderie.

I'm now a sister of the Gamma Nu chapter of Zeta Tau Alpha and I absolutely love it. <img src="https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/t1.0-9/10007419_10203430905559717_993594862_n.jpg" class="images"> Hopefully next year I will be able to get involved with UVa's honor council next year.
